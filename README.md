# BIT

Binary Index Tree.

## Resources:

A couple of useful resourses for anyone looking for more:

 - [tweakblogs entry][tweakblogs] is what I would recomment. After
   understanding the intermediate representation the code becomes
   as clear as day.
 - [This stackexchange question][seIntuition] also has a very nice
   description. It mainly talks about the 'a-ha' moment behind 
   Fenwick Trees.
 - [TopCoder article][topCoderFen], probably something most people
   have read.
 - [Wikipedia entry for Fenwick trees][wikiFenwick], always good to
   give wiki a peak.
